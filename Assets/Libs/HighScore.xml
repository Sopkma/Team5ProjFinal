            Use this method to submit a score to the server. The server will check to see if this
            is a high score or not, so just submit the user's score using this method regardless
            if this is a top tier score or not.

            Call this when the game starts up. This will make sure your team's game is registered
            and will register it if not. Make SURE that the name of the game is exactly the same
            every time this function is called. Changing it will create a new game and I'll have to
            manually remove the old one. Call this method only once but call it every time game starts.
